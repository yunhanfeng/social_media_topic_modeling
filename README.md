# social_media_topic_modeling
As an analyst at UMASH, I conduct topic modeling to detect the topics which related to good or poor metric performance for content marketing strategy

I created several functions for returning specifc topics for social media strategies. 

One is simply to identify topics for all the post with specific topic number.
Second is to identify topics for certain condition of certain metrics the analyst desires to observe. 

Detailed analytics and guideline of these function, please refer to my [Medium Post](https://medium.com/@henryfeng/decide-your-post-topics-on-social-media-with-simple-topic-modeling-8ec1287d0eb9).
